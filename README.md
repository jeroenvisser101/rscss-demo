# RSCSS Demo
To show you guys how to use RSCSS inside our project.

To compile the assets, run one of the following:

- `compass compile`: compiles the assets once.
- `compass watch`: watches the assets for changes and compiles when changed.

You'll have to install compass. If you haven't yet, run `gem install compass`.
